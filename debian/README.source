control.in vs. control
----------------------

As is common with CDBS-based packaged, the debian/control file is
generated (though not automatically) from debian/control.in
Therefore, it is recommended to make any changes to the debian/control.in
file and then regenerate the real debian/control using something like the
following:

    debian/rules clean DEB_MAINTAINER_MODE=1

Please make sure to check the generated debian/control file (as someone might
have committed changes directly to this file without updating debian/control.in
- which might result in a loss of their changes)

CDBS+git-buildpackage
---------------------

This source package uses CDBS and git-buildpackage.  NMUs need not (but
are encouraged to) make special use of these tools.  In particular, the
debian/control.in file can be completely ignored.

More info here: http://wiki.debian.org/CDBS+git-buildpackage
