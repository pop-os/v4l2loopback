Description: Source for the v4l2loopback driver
 This module allows you to create "virtual video devices".
 Normal (v4l2) applications will read these devices as if they were ordinary
 video devices, but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but
 instead it is generated by another application.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the v4l2loopback kernel modules.
