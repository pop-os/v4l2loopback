Description: v4l2loopback modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_)
 This package contains a loadable kernel modules that allows you to create
 "virtual video devices".
 normal (v4l2) applications will read these devices as if they were ordinary
 video devices, but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but
 instead it is generated by another application.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel modules for _KVERS_
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own v4l2loopback-modules. The v4l2loopback-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian's module-assistant or kernel-package
 utilities to produce a version of v4l2loopback-modules for your kernel.
