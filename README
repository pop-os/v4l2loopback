v4l2loopback - a kernel module to create V4L2 loopback devices
==============================================================

this module allows you to create "virtual video devices"
normal (v4l2) applications will read these devices as if they were ordinary
video devices, but the video will not be read from e.g. a capture card but
instead it is generated by another application.
this allows you for instance to apply apply some nifty video effects on your
Skype video...
it also allows some more serious things (e.g. I've been using it to add
streaming capabilities to an application by the means of hooking GStreamer into
the loopback devices).

--- NEWS ---
to get the main features of each new release, see the NEWS file.
you could also have a look at the ChangeLog (which gets automatically generated and might 
only be of limited use...

--- BUILD ---
to build the kernel module run "make".
this should give you a file named "v4l2loopback.ko", which is the kernel module

--- INSTALL ---
to install the module run "make install" (you might have to be 'root' to have
all necessary permissions to install the module).

if your system has "sudo", do:
$ make && sudo make install

if your system lacks "sudo", do:
$ make
$ su
(enter root password)
# make install
# exit

--- RUN ---
Load the v4l2loopback module as root :
# modprobe v4l2loopback

using sudo use:
$ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback

this will create an additional video-device, e.g. /dev/video0 (the number
depends on whether you already had video devices on your system), which can be
fed by various programs.
tested feeders:
	GStreamer: using the  "v4l2sink" element 
	Gem(>=0.93) using the "recordV4L2" plugin
in theory most programs capable of _writing to_ a v4l2 device should work

the data sent to the v4l2loopback device can then be read by any v4l2-capable
application

--- OPTIONS ---
if you need several independent loopback devices, you can pass the "devices"
option, when loading the module; e.g.
# modprobe v4l2loopback devices=4
will give you 4 loopback devices (e.g. /dev/video1 ... /dev/video5)

--- KERNELs ---
the original module has been developed for linux-2.6.28;
further development has been done on linux-2.6.32 and linux-2.6.35, so these 2
are the last kernels known to work with this module
