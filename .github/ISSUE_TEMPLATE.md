To help us making the most of your feedback (so we can e.g. fix bugs more
quickly), please make sure to provide the following information.

Sometimes pictures say more.
However, mostly they prevent the use of advanced
tools (like "search" or "copy&paste").
And always they prevent people who don't use graphical browser to access the

*screenshots of text* whenever feasible (pretty much always).
