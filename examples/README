v4l2loopback tests
==================

test
----

this small sample application will write an image into a v4l2loopback device.
the image will be 640x480 pixels in UYVY colorspace (and since all pixels are
set to "0" it will be green).
the video-device defaults to /dev/video1 but you can specify another device on
the commandline

USAGE:
$ make test
$ ./test /dev/video2 &
$ xawtv -c /dev/video2

if you want to use another device you need to modify the VIDEO_DEVICE define at
the beginning of the code and recompile.

Example using mplayer as a producer for the v4l2loopback driver:

$ mkfifo /tmp/pipe
$ ./yuv4mpeg_to_v4l2 < /tmp/pipe &
$ mplayer movie.mp4 -vo yuv4mpeg:file=/tmp/pipe
