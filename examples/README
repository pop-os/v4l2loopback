v4l2loopback test
=================

this small sample application will write an image into a v4l2loopback device.
the image will be 640x480 pixels in UYVY colorspace (and since all pixels are
set to "0" it will be green).
the video-device is currently hard-coded to /dev/video1

USAGE:
$ make test
$ ./test &
$ xawtv -c /dev/video1

if you want to use another device you need to modify the VIDEO_DEVICE define at
the beginning of the code and recompile.
